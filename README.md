# Accessibility Research Project
This is a school assignment for Fanshawe College's multimedia authoring class. We had to take three pieces of media from our Roku assignment and make them accessible for everyone. The media includes one movie trailer, one tv show trailer and one song.

## Functionality
* Closed captions for tv and movie trailer
* Transcript for audio file
* Increase and decrease size of font buttons
* Back to top button
* Contrasting colours - able to still use website if in black and white
* Extra tips on what buttons do when you hover
* Headers describing what is on screen
* Include icons beside buttons and in control panels
