# Accessibility Research Project
This is a school assignment for Fanshawe College's multimedia authoring class. We had to take three pieces of media from our Roku assignment and make them accessible for everyone. The media includes one movie trailer, one tv show trailer and one song.

**Design:** The interface for my accessibility interface is simple and clean.
